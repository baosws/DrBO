# Implementation for "Causal Discovery via Bayesian Optimization"

DrBO (DAG recovery via Bayesian Optimization) offers a novel approach to score-based causal discovery, focusing on tackling sample-efficiency, that is, how to recover the accurate DAG with as few trials as possible. Employing BO, we effectively utilize exploration data to 

# Setup

```bash
conda create -n drbo python=3.10
